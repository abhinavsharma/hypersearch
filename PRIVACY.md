Hypersearch does not collect any data of any kind. 

- Hypersearch has analytic hooks in the code but they are disabled by default and only enabled for opt-in users who explicitly consent to sharing data.

- The only time Hypersearch connects to a remote server is to update the filter lists and other related assets. 

The project is currently hosted on github.com, which is owned by GitHub, Inc., and thus is unrelated to Hypersearch. 

That is all.
